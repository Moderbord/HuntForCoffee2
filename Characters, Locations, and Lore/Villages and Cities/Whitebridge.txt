Whitebridge is the southermost village in the land of @land. The unforntunate location made Whitebridge the first target for the demonic forces. The defence was taken by surprise, not excpecting an army such as this, and was quickly overrun. Not many people managed to escape, and those who did only made it so far as the closest village before they felt the dark touch spreading through their bodies.
